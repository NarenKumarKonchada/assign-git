• What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?

Ans - It is a file that tells git which files are to be ignored. It is usually used to avoid committing unwanted files such as files created by IDE, .project files, compilation products etc...

These should be included for a JAVA project :

# Compiled class file
*.class

# Log file
*.log

# BlueJ files
*.ctxt

# Mobile Tools for Java (J2ME)
.mtj.tmp/

# Package Files #
*.jar
*.war
*.nar
*.ear
*.zip
*.tar.gz
*.rar

# virtual machine crash logs, see http://www.java.com/en/download/help/error_hotspot.xml

• What does fast-forward in Git mean?

Ans - When we try to merge one commit with a commit that can be reached by following the first commit's history, Git simplifies things by moving the pointer forward and this is because there is no divergent work to merge together. This process is called Fast-forward.

• Why should you have different branches?

Ans- Branching is an effective way to work on different modules of the project and it helps us to shift between different contexts in the project. When there are modules such as UI, backend, testing, bug fixing etc... It keeps the project in proper order and we can always merge modules to the master branch finally.

• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?

Ans - It can be one or many, depending on the project. When u clone your project, by default the local repository is linked to a remote repository and it is named as origin. But we can still add more remote repositories to our project with command "$ git remote add <shortname> <url>.
